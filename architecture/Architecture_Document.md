1) List the classes that you will be using in regards to gameplay with a short description of each class’s purpose. (10
   pts)

2) Please describe your team’s approach to
   leveraging any [interfacing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_interfaces.htm) and [inheritance](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_inheritance.htm) to help with development.
   Additionally, do you foresee these as being useful features in your game’s
   development? (10 pts)

3) Are you using any [Factories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) in this project? If so, please
   describe them. Additionally, please describe any factories that you think your
   team may need in the future for this game. (5 pts, even if you don’t include
   them.)

4) Please include a simplified diagram that
   helps visually illustrate your gameplay’s current architecture. (Think of
   something like a [UML Class Diagram](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml/#class-diagram), but a little more
   simplified.) You must also include a description for the interactions of the
   systems within this diagram. (20 pts)

5) Please include a simplified diagram to help
   visually illustrate what your final project’s architecture will look like.
   (This is just an estimate, so it’s okay if your final project does not turn out
   like this!) (20 pts)
