## Course Description

This is the first of a two-semester course that focuses on 2D game development.

Students will work together in teams of four in order to create a game using C++. Students will receive a [whitelist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N-y8vQ7DIsGTn02DUnWgGQ48UIrKjU-PrQkNL4yGPmo/edit?usp=sharing) of a few allowed libraries, but beyond that, use of other middleware such as physics engines, networking libraries, etc., are explicitly prohibited.

Additional topics will be covered in lectures, such as software architecture, development practices, fundamentals of team dynamics, task prioritization, and game development secrets.

## 

## Objectives

**Teamwork:**

- Communicate in a team setting to coordinate with others  
- Independently and fairly resolve intragroup conflict

**Development Process:**

- See the process from start-to-finish of a larger project  
- Plan out milestones and learn to prioritize tasks  
- Scoping projects more effectively with a larger project  
- Learn more about vital development skills, such as: Research, documentation, A/B testing, source control, formal code reviews, HCI, automated and unit testing, data parsing, cross-platform development, gameplay design approaches, etc.

**Core Development Roles:**

- Take on roles within your team to learn more in-depth disciplines, such as: Code architecture, 2D rendering/animation, VFX and particles, UI/UX and interface design, physics, audio and SFX, component design, etc.

**Personal Growth:**

- Learn new technology or practices based off of your desires, not the requirements of the course  
- Familiarize yourself with the different roles in game design projects to find one that *you* enjoy the most

## Academic Integrity

Academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated in this course. Cheating, copying, plagiarizing, or any other form of academic dishonesty (including doing someone else’s individual assignments) will result in, at the extreme minimum, a zero on that assignment, and could result in a failing grade in the course or even expulsion from DigiPen. More information can be found in the [Academic Integrity/Dishonesty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfWzKhgbhijqeiznlMIvWUPLmRKSnuUfxN66JpCmCaE/edit?usp=sharing) document. Submitting AI-generated code, artwork, or text as your own will also be considered plagiarism for the purpose of this class.

Please do not cheat because I will cry. 😭

## Respect

I expect students to respect one another, as well as respecting all faculty. We should all respect each other’s time, boundaries, and worth.

I also ask that you please refrain from being too distracted with your phone, playing games, social media, or working on assignments. You may be asked to leave and will be counted as [absent](#bookmark=id.thr78kz6wuad) for the class.

My friend told me that she was enrolled in a class where her classmate was clearly playing League of Legends every class. Because the classmate was never paying attention, the classmate never knew what to do in the group assignment. Please do not be like that student… ☹️

## We’re All Human

We’re all human. This means that we all have imperfections and go through our own troubles. If you are going through problems, if you believe that your grades do not accurately reflect the work you’ve put in, or you think there was a mistake, I’m open to hearing you out as long as you are kind. I can offer an explanation for the grading, as well as feedback on how to improve in the future. Oftentimes, it just takes seeing things from a different perspective or better planning to avoid common pitfalls.

## Questions

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me using my DigiPen e-mail address: [jonathan.holmes@digipen.edu](mailto:jonathan.holmes@digipen.edu) . I will try to respond in a reasonable amount of time\! If you would like to have a one-on-one conversation with me, please message me via Discord or e-mail to request a time to meet up 1-on-1.

You can directly message me on Discord. Please do not ask, *“Professor, can I ask you a question?”* The answer will always be, *“Yes.”* 🤪 Just ask the question\!

If you need clarification on something, or you cannot understand the way I have phrased something, or you do not understand my word choice, **please** ask for clarification. I will prioritize these kinds of requests to ensure that every student has a fair chance of success.

## Grading Policy

Scoring in this course may be a little different than you are used to. Instead of using a point system, all DigiPen assignments and deliverables will be graded on the following scale:

| F   | D   | C   | B   | A   | S   |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

The final scores will be slightly adjusted based on class participation, student enthusiasm, willingness to resolve team conflict, and contributions to team projects. Final scores will also be adjusted to meet KMU requirements.

## Grade Breakdown

Your final score will be comprised of the following:

| Assignment                                                   | Percentage       |

## Milestone 1 Deliverable:

The first milestone deliverable focuses on planning and documentation. While this may be a small portion of your Final Score, I encourage you to take this presentation very seriously. The feedback you receive from this deliverable may be invaluable. *Remember, some sort of prototype is required.*

## Milestone 2 Deliverable:

The second milestone focuses around proof-of-concept of your team’s engine (that was mostly worked on in CS230) and phasing out Raylib and unallowed code in favor of basic graphics/input code, while also making sure everyone is getting into the groove of working in the same environment/pipeline. This new code can include code from CS200 and other courses, but it cannot be counted as ‘new’ code in the [Coding Reports](#bookmark=id.nsffsee70i1a).

## Milestone 3 Deliverable:

For the third milestone, your team’s game should be playable. The game does not need to be complete, but the game should showcase the main features (gameplay mechanics) or gameloop, which is necessary for a class playtest for this milestone.

## Milestone 4 Final Deliverable:

At the end of the semester, teams will be required to turn in their final projects, submitting their final game code. While not perfect, the game should be fully playable and should be something that you’re proud of. 👍

| Percentage | Due Date | Graded Components                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Coding Reports:

Coding Reports are due at the same time that the milestone deliverables are being turned in. (Except for Milestone 1\) The purpose of the Coding Reports is to assess how much work each team member is contributing to the project. While all students have their own roles, we’re all working on becoming better developers, so we all need to contribute to the overall project’s codebase.

Coding Reports are ways for each team to come together to agree on how much code each developer has contributed and to ensure everyone is splitting the work fairly. Because only one Coding Report needs to be submitted for each team, the Coding Report will be submitted by each team’s Technical Lead. [Follow the Coding Report guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HfxW07qIm-MR4xS6clhUM84ERYGhhhaAEiMdCuV_KU/edit?usp=sharing).

If you do not do enough lines of code in one of the milestones, it will make the next milestone requirement harder to reach\!

## Weekly Status Reports:

Starting on Week 2 until Week 14, each team’s producer will be required to submit a Weekly Status Report via Moodle. This report must include:  
• 1\~2 sentence summary of what each team member did during the past week.  
• 1\~2 sentence summary of what each team member plans to achieve during the next week.  
• Any team conflicts during the week and the solution that the team has come up with to fix the conflict.  
• Any major changes in team roles.  
• Anything else you think I should know about.  
• A rating 1\~10 on how confident you, as a producer, are that the team will accomplish every goal by the next milestone.

## In-Class Playtest:

The first class following Milestone 3, we will have a class playtest session. Each student will spend an amount of time playing each game, including their own. Afterwards, the students must submit a report on Moodle**.** For each game that you played, you must include:

- A rating 1\~10 on how much you enjoyed the game, overall.  
- A 2\~3 sentence summary of what you did while playing the game.  
- Anything you found frustrating about the game.  
- Anything you found fun about the game.  
- Any gameplay improvements to make the game more fun.  
- Any notes on what you did not understand about the game.  
- Any additional information you’d want to give to the team.  
- What bugs did you find?

All feedback will be submitted to the appropriate team's producer to review.

## Team Evaluations:

Twice during this semester, you will be required to submit Team Evaluations via Moodle**.** For every member on your team (including yourself), you must include the following:

- Member name  
- A rating 1\~10 of the effort of this member. (How much they are contributing.)  
- Why do they deserve this score? (2\~3 sentences)  
- What are they doing best? (Optional)  
- How could they improve? (Optional)

## Attendance:

Attendance is required for this class. Your grade will not be increased for merely attending the class, but you will have your grade penalized if you do miss too many classes. This penalty will be taken off of your Final Score. 😲

| Number of Unexcused Absences | Points Deducted From Final Score |

| N                            | N \* 5 \- 10                     |

Excused absences include being sick, family emergencies, and school-approved activities. In order for your absence to be excused, you must send an e-mail to [jonathan.holmes@digipen.edu](mailto:jonathan.holmes@digipen.edu) . You must tell me why you’re absent, as well as format your subject as:

**ABSENCE \- GAM200 \- YOUR NAME (한국어로) \- DATE OF ABSENCE**

Being 15 minutes late to class will result in an unexcused absence. Leaving too early from class will result in an unexcused absence. I might ask goofy questions during each class in order to check attendance instead of just checking who’s online.

## Extra Credit:

Extra credit may be announced throughout the semester… I may ask that students do something special, like sharing helpful experiences with classes, bringing up great questions during discussions, or bringing interesting solutions to my attention. At my discretion, I’ll also secretly award students extra credit points whenever I see them take initiative or show special enthusiasm for their project/team.

## Creating Teams:

During the first day of class, you’ll be asked to try to join together to create teams for the semester’s project. Teams may not have less than 3 students and may not have more than 5\. Groups of 4 is greatly preferred.

Over the past few years, teams of 3 have almost always underperformed- Several years ago, the average score for teams of 3 was at least 10 points lower on their Final Grade. Because of the lackluster games that teams of 3 usually produce, I greatly discourage teams of 3\. The expected work will not decrease if you have less members.

During the second day of class, I’ll confirm teams. Anyone that is yet to have joined a team will have a last chance to join a team. Don’t wait too long because I might find a team for you\! 🤭 So, take advantage of the opportunity.

Teams will be required to come up with a team name and name for their game. These can be anything you want, as long as they’re E-10. If your team submits names that’s not appropriate, you will be asked to change them.

If your team decides to use a name with a hidden meaning that is inappropriate and it is not discovered until later (because of some pop culture reference or hidden linguistic meaning), the entire team will receive a failing grade in this class. 😢

## Changing Teams:

Before Milestone 3, if a student would like to leave a team, that student must meet with me during my office hours. The later the student waits to change teams, the more reluctant I will be to change a student’s team. This will come at no penalty to the student. I may request that the entire team meet with me in order to discuss the matter.

If a team would like to kick out a specific member, the rest of the team must all show up to discuss the topic with me during my office hours. The team must unanimously be in favor of kicking out the other student. The next step would be to have another meeting with all the students, including the student that you would like to remove from the group. There is no guarantee that I’ll decide to remove the student from your group.

Whenever a student departs from a group, the student is required to uphold academic integrity, so do not do something disruptive, such as deleting code from a repository. You will be punished.

## Scrums:

Teams are required to have at least 1 team meeting over video call or some other format. It’s up to the team to figure out *when* and *how* these meetings will occur. Be conscientious and respectful of other people’s schedules. Ultimately, the team’s producer will set this time.

These scrums will help the producer keep track of what everyone’s working on for their [Weekly Status Reports](#bookmark=id.53j5x8agz15u). They will also give a chance for the Test Lead to discuss the state of the backlog of bugs.

Throughout the year, I may ask students to do special tasks during their Scrum meetings. This time might also be used in rare circumstances to discuss any problems that the team is having with the professor in the case where the entire team cannot meet during office hours.

## Team Roles:

Students will take on several roles when creating their game in a group. I generally ask that roles are agreed on before Milestone 1, but students can change roles or take on new roles as the project is fleshed out over time.

However, each team is required to always have the following roles:

| Role           | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Group Presentations:

All group presentations in this class will be required to be 11\~15 minutes and must be accompanied by a slideshow. (Videos or gameplay along with the slideshow are allowed.) Of course, each student must present during the presentation. The professor, the class, and outsiders may join in watching the presentations, as well.

After each presentation, there will be a Questions & Answers session where anyone from the audience may ask appropriate questions to the team. Teams are expected to be prepared to handle these questions.

Presentation templates can be found, here:

- [Milestone 1 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E1lSE96EDrDxu8MGPHfNH5pwm27W3Y3M/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105228926762272251827&rtpof=true&sd=true)  
- [Milestone 2 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ibhHrPYOTXb7Nj-kCIis0vtuqi1GRDo3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105228926762272251827&rtpof=true&sd=true)  
- [Milestone 3 (Final) Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tVOzbiCzkH-goxCTRWn3UAVkVbugaYyL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105228926762272251827&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Team Milestone Report:

Team Milestone Reports are documents that help graders understand more about your project’s direction. While it’s not too difficult to complete these reports, they should be taken seriously as they can really help guide your team in assessing your project’s scope, while helping to give some ideas about what a good final project may look like.

Team Milestone Reports are different for each milestone. Make sure you’re turning in the proper report for each milestone, please\!

- [Milestone 1 Team Milestone Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UWd-XoxAMuu0fixeIB5EEv-EIJUqDl9gV46XeuCCWtY/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Milestone 2 Team Milestone Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKxDwO8-o9X0pkLYh6sAp1AZFPNv6nLJLZ_Zh-bWvoI/edit#)  
- [Milestone 3 Team Milestone Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13mU5LWn-J38GVphRHXKTjcGjvItgMXRvSqn7wvoJI_o/edit?usp=sharing)

## Individual Milestone Report:

The Individual Milestone Report is a document that’s designed to gauge your individual contributions and share your opinions on the team’s project for Milestones 2, 3, and 4\. Although several questions are opinion-based and cannot be objectively graded, it’s important to answer these questions truthfully and thoroughly. [The Individual Milestone Report can be found, here.](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1-aPmzfHn1Vj0o7mWc_DoY7nQErLa2gKNsQ60iM6_lJo/edit)

## Game Design Mock-Up:

The Game Design Mock-Up is a simple document that will be created to help illustrate the team’s game design wishes. These designs can and usually do change throughout the semester. That’s okay\! [The assignment can be found, here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3aD2ohCPQq_4cvk4RgFnQXlGBybZw2hUbsoM7tHVTg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Architecture Document:

The Architecture Document is a simple document that will be created and submitted for Milestone 2\. It is used to help visualize the current state of the project and desired direction of the project, from a technical perspective. [The assignment can be found, here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2Ud2cKtzWUParh082ZXdSlBAufXTvvbPtEXA8xM-CQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Technical & Design Guides:

At the end of the semester, as part of the Milestone 4 Deliverable, your team will be asked to submit a Technical Guide and Design Guide. These are two documents showcase your project’s technical and design execution. These assignments can be found, here:

- [Milestone 4 Technical Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4ei62VX--F4PyOFwPVRZ8TK-_ybN3JG2uAot0kSOlA/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Milestone 4 Design Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19dW2VjbMYBHfF69znv4CIffOKPqqpxoJUrFEG-PLxFA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Submitting Assignments:

All assignments are submitted through [Moodle](https://distance3.sg.digipen.edu/2021sg-fall/course/view.php?id=474). You are expected to turn your work in by the due dates on [Moodle](https://distance3.sg.digipen.edu/2021sg-fall/course/view.php?id=474) for all of your assignments… However, for documents and assignments that only have to be turned in once per group, you don’t have to worry about turning anything in if someone else in your group has uploaded the assignment.

## Submitting Code & Source Control:

Teams are required to keep track of their code using GitHub’s source control and *git*. The team repositories should be within the GitHub classroom at this link so that I have viewing privileges: [https://classroom.github.com/a/9zMUCWCG](https://classroom.github.com/a/9zMUCWCG)

Though your team will be developing and working on your project through GitHub, for milestone deliverables, your team’s code will be submitted through Moodle in a .ZIP archive. This code will be compiled into a game on my machine, so you will need to include compilation instructions.

When submitting code, [you also must follow these guidelines in order to create a ReadMe file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yfcYTVKjkDQcBYtGhoCb_m-mE-hSKEReSg8SC19p_gE/edit?usp=sharing) that anyone can use to install, run, and play your game. If you do not include this, I probably won’t be able to grade your code\!

For Milestone 2, [I’ll be using this rubric from a previous class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRV9oFbCZ7mlt5VCVbbhYbcPoxwep6kCtyuhI2qoWPI/edit?usp=sharing) to decide the general score for the submitted code. I don’t like this rubric’s grading, though… So, I won’t use the exact values for each of these guidelines… I’ll just use this as a general guide for this milestone. I may create an entirely new rubric that makes this one a little easier to read, in the future.

Milestone 4’s rubric will be based off of a more complex set of guidelines. [A previous year’s guidelines can be found, here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ySEzbGjAcjYfnu3Gss_gzn9nUoOYjbf6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105228926762272251827&rtpof=true&sd=true), but I may also recreate this rubric so that this will be a little easier to read.

## Late Policy:

Your assignments for this semester will be a portion of group effort. I highly suggest that you and your team work together to get your assignments turned in on time. Other professors will not take late work. Under extreme circumstances, I may or may not take in late work. If I do, your score will be penalized, substantially. Please avoid letting your teammates down.

## Game Content:

Games developed in this course should only include content that is appropriate for ages 0\~14. This means no sexual or explicit context is allowed. To go a step further, this class encourages students to create games that are exciting, fun, with expressive game mechanics. These games are not designed to be story-heavy or narrative-focused games. While those games can be fun, they tend to either take too much time creating text and dialog at the expense of development time. They also take too much time away from play testers.

## Attributions:

All code, visuals, libraries, assets, etc, etc, that are *not* created by and owned by students *must* specify when submitting milestones. Students must also abide by all attribution requirements when using assets that have been retrieved from outside sources… For instance, if a website states that the rights to use a song in a game rely on a copyright notice within the game, the copyright notice must appear within the game by the time the milestone is reached and the code is submitted.
